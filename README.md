# **Systolic Array**

This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of a systolic array, a specialized hardware architecture designed for efficient matrix multiplication and linear algebra operations. The systolic array is a foundational component for hardware acceleration in applications like machine learning, signal processing, and high-performance computing.
